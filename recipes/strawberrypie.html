    <h2>Tasty strawberry pie</h2>
    <p1>This is my favourite strawberry pie, and it's very easy to prepare. The recipe was gotten many years ago from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm in North Jersey</p1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul><li>1 quart fresh strawberrries, hulled</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol> <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastery shell. Place remaining SB in a medium saucepan</li>
        <li>Add sugar to the SB in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a bowl. Stir cornstarch mixture gradually into boiling strawberry mixture. Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes stirring constantly</li>
        <li>Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Serve each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
